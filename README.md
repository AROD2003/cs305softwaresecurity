# cs305softwaresecurity

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates financial plans for clients. The issue they wanted to be addressed was to modernize their operations and ensure client data was secured. They specifically wanted me to address/add communication mechanisms, like checksum. 

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I think I did a good job of code review and testing to see vulnerabilities. It is very important to code securely because it protects not only customers data, but important company-specific data. It also ensures that you meet any state/country regulations and compliances.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Analyzing static testing tools was challenging but helpful to me to identify vulnerabilities that might not be immediately apparent during a manual code review. 

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I switched from HTTP -> HTTPS protocol, added encryption algorithms (checksum), and using secure code. In the future, using vulnerability scanning tools will help me to, well assess vulnerabilities. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I did multiple things such as running he program and performing data checks worked correctly. Using static analysis tests after refactoring to make sure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The maven dependency check tool was very useful for me and I plan to use it in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them a before and after of the assignment. Basically, show them my footprint and skills.
